        <h1>Using the &lt;blockquote&gt; Element</h1>
        
        <p>The &lt;blockquote&gt; element is used to indicate that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. It is typically displayed as an indented block of text.</p>
        
        <h2>Example of Blockquote:</h2>
        
        <blockquote>
            "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today." 
            <br> - Franklin D. Roosevelt
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>In this example, the quote from Franklin D. Roosevelt is enclosed within the &lt;blockquote&gt; tags, which will render it as a distinct block of text, usually indented from the rest of the content.</p>
